      <description>In March 2020 the COVID pandemic was just beginning to strike the United States. During that month of massive uncertainty, this is what I messaged my team:

Was Techstars a permanent hackathon fueled by Soylent and Adderall? Was it three months of guest speakers and sponsored happy hours?</description>
