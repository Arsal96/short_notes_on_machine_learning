- [Mitchell et. al 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)
    - No standard documentation for ML models
        - "Currently, there are no standardized documentation procedures to
    communicate the performance characteristics of trained machine
    learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models." (Mitchell et. al 2019)
    - Original proposal
        "As a step towards this goal, we propose that released machine
learning models be accompanied by short (one to two page) records
we call model cards"
    - "We advocate for measures of model performance that contain
quantitative evaluation results to be broken down by individual
cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups, domain-relevant conditions, and intersectional analysis combining two (or more) groups
and conditions"
"Before further discussing the details of the model card, it is important to note that at least two of the three characteristics discussed
so far, race and gender, are socially sensitive. Although analyzing
models by race and gender may follow from intersectionality theory, how “ground truth” race or gender categories should be labeled
in a dataset, and whether or not datasets should be labeled with
these categories at all, is not always clear"
