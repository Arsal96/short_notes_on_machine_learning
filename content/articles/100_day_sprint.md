The last few years have been hard for me. Entering 2021, I am out of shape, obese, have high blood pressure, and a pretty high heart rate. All these give me an elevated risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, which spreads with no end in sight. I have also stalled intellectually. I am learning and creating less than ever. 

Ten years ago I'd go for a run at midnight and study till dawn. Can I get back there? This page is a small record of a 100 day sprint to find out.

All study sessions are [published on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisAlbonVideos) and daily metrics are presented here:
